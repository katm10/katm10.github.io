            <h3>September 17, 2016</h3>
            <p>I attended Coding Cup at MuleSoft with my friend, and we won the competition!
              With the help of three others, we made a prototype of a social platform
              to get more girls in tech, Mentor Meet. You can see our pitch
              <a href="katm10.github.io/mentormeet.github.io/index.html">here </a>and our website

              but the idea is there). I am planning to turn it into a working app in
              the near future, so stayed tuned for the updates! This was a fun hackathon;
              thank you so much to the sponsors! Also, check out the tweets about the

            <p>With the help of Alaina Kafkes's API tutorial, I wrote a Python program
              that uses Bing and Twitter APIs to tweet random stock photos and sentences
              to hopefully produce a hilarious tweet! You can check out my code on GitHub

            <h3>June 24-25, 2016</h3>
            <p>I entered a B-Stem Project hack-a-thon with my program, Sharon. You can
              learn more about our project on&nbsp;
              <a href="#http://devpost.com/software/sharon-7mnqtu">Devpost</a>&nbsp;or on our
              <a href="#https://sharontherobot.squarespace.com/">website prototype</a>, but the TL;DR is that&nbsp;Sharon is an automated SMS messaging robot
              that allows users within the same zipcode to discuss important topics in
              their community in a safe and anonymous way. &nbsp;I worked on this project
              with two other high schoolers, who focused on the website and marketing.
              While they did that, I wrote the program in C# on Visual Studios by using
              the documentation for Outlook add-ins. I was new to all of these, but it
              was surprisingly easy. Despite the differences, much of my knowledge about
              Java applied to C#, which was very helpful. After working on this for two
              days, we submitted our project, and it won! Thanks to B-Stem and Microsoft
              for this hack-a-thon.</p>

            <h3>May 21, 2016</h3>
            <p>Every Sunday throughout the 2015-2016 schoolyear, I attended Girls Who
              Code mettings. Here, I learned more about HTML/CSS, Java, Git, and Android
              Development. In fact, this GWC club inspired me to create my app, Speedy
              Digits. Through GWC, I also went on fieldtrips to Facebook, LinkedIn, and
              Udacity. I cannot thank my wonderful instructors and GWC enough for all
              their support and help. It has taught me so much about computer science
              and I am very excited to participate in this club again next year!</p>

              in the field of computer science. I recieved the Ceritificate of Distinction
              award because I live in the Silicon Valley, one of the most competitive
              regions for computer science, so although my application wasn't the best
              in my region, the board still believed I deserved an award for my interest
              in programming. It is an honor to recieve this award and you can see my

            <p>I attended the Girls Teaching Girls to Code Code Camp on April 9, and
              it was a great experience. I got to meet mentors who were attending Stanford
              for computer science majors and talk with them abut their experiences coding.
              At the Code Camp, I also attended an Artificial Intelligence and a Music
              in Technology workshop. It was great to learn about the different ways
              computer science can be utilized and to see coding in many contexts. Here,
              I programmed a simple Python &nbsp;movie recommender that reccomended movies
              based on a movie you chose. I also programmed a Java guitar game that is
              similar to Guitar Hero. Afterward, I got to listen to a panel of female
              speakers as they discussed the computer industry and challenges within
              it. I loved learning about not only coding, but also about the indusry
              as a whole and how to "lean in" and work hard.</p>

              me from getting very far. I continued to work on it every Sunday, trying
              out different code structures and API settings, until I had an app that
              I would be proud to publish. In doing so, I learned much about recursive
              functions, APIs, and Android App Development. However, only a few after
              publishing, my computer, whose hard drive contained all of my Git files,
              &nbsp;broke, so I wasn't able to work out the bugs until recently. The

              How can we reduce our carbon emissions while increasing community resilience
              in the Bay Area? To solve this, my team came up with the idea for Me &gt;
              Meat. Me &gt; Meat is an app that allows you to see how much carbon dioxide,
              methane, and water is used in the process of harvesting different meat
              products by scanning the barcode. Once you do this, other, more eco-friendly
              products will also appear with recipes for each of them in the hope that
              we can decrease meat consumption and thus decrease carbon dioxide emissions.
              Although we weren't able to complete the app, I will try to program it
              over the summer, so keep an eye out for further notice! ☺ You can view
              the first prototype

              had never met, organize and manage my team, use human-based design, and
              prototype.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>On March 17, I attended a Girls Who Code Hack-a-Thon over at Udacity!It
              was an amazing experience, fo I got to meet the people who created much
              of the Udacity content that I love! During this 2-hour hack-a-thon, we
              were put into teams with other coders whom we had never met, and we got
              the task of developing a way to make more girls interested in coding. As
              a team, we all shared an idea we had and voted to determine what we would
              do. I wanted to make a mural that incorporated images of amazing women
              in tech and could be used as a "selfie wall", but my idea didn't get enough
              votes. (If anyone wants to make this concept a reality, contact me using
              the info below.) Out final idea was to make a Youtube channel that incorporated
              different videos about the technology field, and although we lost, it was
              a wonderful experience! You can read about the winning team at the Girls
