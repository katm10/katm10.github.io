            <p contenteditable="true">I began working on Speedy Digits during winter break, but school prevented
              me from getting very far. I continued to work on it every Sunday, trying
              out different code structures and API settings, until I had an app that
              I would be proud to publish. In doing so, I learned much about recursive
              functions, APIs, and Android App Development. However, only a few after
              publishing, my computer, whose hard drive contained all of my Git files,
              &nbsp;broke, so I will not be able to work out the bugs until further notice.
              You can download Speedy Digits

            <h1>Me &gt; Meat (Resilience Challenge)</h1>
            <h3>January - March 2016</h3>
            <p>From January until March, &nbsp;I participated in the Resilience Challenge
              in San Francisco. &nbsp;If you are interested, you can learn more about
              it&nbsp;
              <a href="steam.directory.com">at their homepage for participants</a>or
              <a href="https://mixresilience.splashthat.com/">at their public website.</a>In this challenge, we had to come up with a solution to this problem:
              How can we reduce our carbon emissions while increasing community resilience
              in the Bay Area? To solve this, my team came up with the idea for Me &gt;
              Meat. Me &gt; Meat is an app that allows you to see how much carbon dioxide,
              methane, and water is used in the process of harvesting different meat
              products by scanning the barcode. Once you do this, other, more eco-friendly
              products will also appear with recipes for each of them in the hope that
              we can decrease meat consumption and thus decrease carbon dioxide emissions.
              Although we weren't able to complete the app, I will try to program it
              over the summer, so keep an eye out for further notice! ☺ You can view
              the first prototype
              <a href="https://marvelapp.com/49dgc4g">here</a>or our second prototype
              <a href="https://marvelapp.com/acaeb5">here.</a>&nbsp;In this challenge, I learned how to work with a team of people I
              had never met, organize and manage my team, use human-based design, and
              prototype.&nbsp;</p>

            <h1>Udacity Girls Who Code&nbsp;
              <br>Hack-a-Thon</h1>
            <h3>March 17, 2016</h3>
            <p>On March 17, I attended a Girls Who Code Hack-a-Thon over at Udacity!It
              was an amazing experience, fo I got to meet the people who created much
              of the Udacity content that I love! During this 2-hour hack-a-thon, we
              were put into teams with other coders whom we had never met, and we got
              the task of developing a way to make more girls interested in coding. As
              a team, we all shared an idea we had and voted to determine what we would
              do. I wanted to make a mural that incorporated images of amazing women
              in tech and could be used as a "selfie wall", but my idea didn't get enough
              votes. (If anyone wants to make this concept a reality, contact me using
              the info below.) Out final idea was to make a Youtube channel that incorporated
              different videos about the technology field, and although we lost, it was
              a wonderful experience! You can read about the winning team at the Girls
              Who Code blog.</p>
